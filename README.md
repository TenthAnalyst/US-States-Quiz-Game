# US States Quiz Game

> The US States Quiz Game is a very simple Python project that allows users to play a quiz game to guess the names of US states on a map. It was created as part of the *"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"* course on Udemy, as an exercise to work with CSV data and introduce the Pandas library.

## Features

-   Interactive game that displays a map of the US with states outlined
-   Users can input the names of states to guess their locations on the map
-   Game keeps track of correct guesses and displays the remaining states to guess
-   Uses Pandas library to read and manipulate data from a CSV file

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone` or by downloading the ZIP file.
2.  Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the game using a Python interpreter by executing `python quiz_game.py` in the terminal.

## Usage

1.  Start the game by running the `quiz_game.py` script.
2.  Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the locations of US states on the map.
3.  Input the name of a state and press Enter to see if your guess is correct.
4.  The game will keep track of your correct guesses and display the remaining states to guess.
5.  Continue playing until you have guessed all the states or choose to exit the game by typing "exit".
6.  At the end, it will generate a csv file of the states you missed.
